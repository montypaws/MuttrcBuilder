Useful to avoid the tampering\n#   certain mail delivery and transport agents tend to do with messages.\n#\n#  envelope_from\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, mutt will try to derive the message's envelope sender from the\n#   \"From:\" header. Note that this information is passed to sendmail command\n#   using the \"-f\" command line switch, so don't set this option if you are\n#   using that switch in $sendmail yourself, or if the sendmail on your machine\n#   doesn't support that command line switch.\n#\n#  escape\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"~\"\n#\n#   Escape character to use for functions in the builtin editor.\n#\n#  fast_reply\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped when\n#   replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is skipped when\n#   forwarding messages.\n#\n#   Note: this variable has no effect when the `` $autoedit'' variable is set.\n#\n#  fcc_attach\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages are\n#   saved along with the main body of your message.\n#\n#  fcc_clear\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and unsigned,\n#   even when the actual message is encrypted and/or signed.\n#\n#  folder\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"~/Mail\"\n#\n#   Specifies  the default location of your mailboxes. A `+' or `=' at the\n#   beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of this variable. Note\n#   that if you change this variable from the default value you need to make\n#   sure that the assignment occurs before you use `+' or `=' for any other\n#   variables since expansion takes place during the `set' command.\n#\n#  folder_format\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f\"\n#\n#   This variable allows you to customize the file browser display to your\n#   personal taste.

When set, Mutt will generate this field when you are replying\n#   to a known mailing list, specified with the ``subscribe'' or `` lists''\n#   commands.\n#\n#   This field has two purposes. First, preventing you from receiving duplicate\n#   copies of replies to messages which you send to mailing lists. Second,\n#   ensuring that you do get a reply separately for any messages sent to known\n#   lists to which you are not subscribed. The header will contain only the\n#   list's address for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own\n#   email address for unsubscribed lists. Without this header, a group reply to\n#   your message sent to a subscribed list will be sent to both the list and\n#   your address, resulting in two copies of the same email for you.\n#\n#  force_name\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   This variable is similar to `` $save_name'', except that Mutt will store a\n#   copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address you are sending\n#   to even if that mailbox does not exist.\n#\n#   Also see the `` $record'' variable.\n#\n#  forward_decode\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   Controls  the  decoding  of complex MIME messages into text/plain when\n#   forwarding a message. The message header is also RFC2047 decoded. This\n#   variable  is  only  used, if `` $mime_forward'' is unset, otherwise ``\n#   $mime_forward_decode'' is used instead.\n#\n#  forward_format\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"[%a: %s]\"\n#\n#   This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message. It\n#   uses the same format sequences as the `` $index_format'' variable.\n#\n#  forward_quote\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set forwarded messages included in the main body of the message (when\n#   `` $mime_forward'' is unset) will be quoted using `` $indent_string''.\n#\n#  from\n#\n#   Type: e-mail address\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   When  set,  this  variable  contains a default from address. It can be\n#   overridden using my_hdr (including from send-hooks) and `` $reverse_name''.\n#\n#   Defaults to the EMAIL environment variable's content.\n#\n#  gecos_mask\n#\n#   Type: regular expression\n#   Default: \"^[^,]*\"\n#\n#   A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password\n#   entry when expanding the alias. By default the regular expression is set to\n#   \"^[^,]*\" which will return the string up to the first \",\" encountered. If\n#   the GECOS field contains a string like \"lastname, firstname\" then you should\n#   set the gecos_mask=\".*\".\n#\n#   This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address a e-mail\n#   to user ID stevef whose full name is Steve Franklin. If mutt expands stevef\n#   to \"Franklin\" stevef@foo.bar then you should set the gecos_mask to a regular\n#   expression that will match the whole name so mutt will expand \"Franklin\" to\n#   \"Franklin, Steve\".\n#\n#  hdrs\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When unset, the header fields normally added by the `` my_hdr'' command are\n#   not created. This variable must be unset before composing a new message or\n#   replying in order to take effect. If set, the user defined header fields are\n#   added to every new message.\n#\n#  header\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the header of the message you\n#   are replying to into the edit buffer. The `` $weed'' setting applies.\n#\n#  help\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When  set,  help lines describing the bindings for the major functions\n#   provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.\n#\n#   Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the function is bound\n#   to a sequence rather than a single keystroke. Also, the help line may not be\n#   updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is running. Since this variable\n#   is primarily aimed at new users, neither of these should present a major\n#   problem.\n#\n#  hidden_host\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, mutt will skip the host name part of `` $hostname'' variable when\n#   adding the domain part to addresses. This variable does not affect the\n#   generation  of  Message-IDs,  and  it  will not lead to the cut-off of\n#   first-level domains.\n#\n#  hide_limited\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the thread\n#   tree.\n#\n#  hide_missing\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden by\n#   limiting, in the thread tree.\n#\n#  hide_top_limited\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the top of\n#   threads in the thread tree. Note that when $hide_limited is set, this option\n#   will have no effect.\n#\n#  hide_top_missing\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden by\n#   limiting,  at  the  top  of  threads in the thread tree.Note that when\n#   $hide_missing is set, this option will have no effect.\n#\n#  history\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 10\n#\n#   This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of the\n#   string history buffer. The buffer is cleared each time the variable is set.\n#\n#  honor_followup_to\n#\n#   Type: quadoption\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is honored\n#   when group-replying to a message.\n#\n#  hostname\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   Specifies the hostname to use after the ``@'' in local e-mail addresses.\n#   This overrides the compile time definition obtained from /etc/resolv.conf.\n#\n#  ignore_list_reply_to\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   Affects the behaviour of the reply function when replying to messages from\n#   mailing lists. When set, if the ``Reply-To:'' field is set to the same value\n#   as the ``To:'' field, Mutt assumes that the ``Reply-To:'' field was set by\n#   the mailing list to automate responses to the list, and will ignore this\n#   field. To direct a response to the mailing list when this option is set, use\n#   the list-reply function; group-reply will reply to both the sender and the\n#   list.\n#\n#  imap_authenticators\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may attempt to\n#   use  to  log  in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt should try them.\n#   Authentication methods are either 'login' or the right side of an IMAP\n#   'AUTH=xxx' capability string, eg 'digest-md5', 'gssapi' or 'cram-md5'. This\n#   parameter is case-insensitive. If this parameter is unset (the default) mutt\n#   will try all available methods, in order from most-secure to least-secure.\n#\n#   Example: set imap_authenticators=\"gssapi:cram-md5:login\"\n#\n#   Note:  Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if the\n#   previous  methods  are  unavailable.  If  a  method  is  available but\n#   authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.\n#\n#  imap_delim_chars\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"/.\"\n#\n#   This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat as folder\n#   separators for displaying IMAP paths. In particular it helps in using the\n#   '=' shortcut for your folder variable.\n#\n#  imap_force_ssl\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If this variable is set, Mutt will always use SSL when connecting to IMAP\n#   servers.\n#\n#  imap_home_namespace\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   You normally want to see your personal folders alongside your INBOX in the\n#   IMAP browser. If you see something else, you may set this variable to the\n#   IMAP path to your folders.\n#\n#  imap_keepalive\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 900\n#\n#   This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that mutt will\n#   wait  before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server from\n#   closing them before mutt has finished with them. The default is well within\n#   the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before a server is\n#   allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get violated every now and\n#   then. Reduce this number if you find yourself getting disconnected from your\n#   IMAP server due to inactivity.\n#\n#  imap_list_subscribed\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for only\n#   subscribed folders or all folders. This can be toggled in the IMAP browser\n#   with the toggle-subscribed function.\n#\n#  imap_pass\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   Specifies the password for your IMAP account. If unset, Mutt will prompt you\n#   for your password when you invoke the fetch-mail function. Warning: you\n#   should only use this option when you are on a fairly secure machine, because\n#   the superuser can read your muttrc even if you are the only one who can read\n#   the file.\n#\n#  imap_passive\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new mail.\n#   Mutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP connections. This is\n#   useful if you don't want to be prompted to user/password pairs on mutt\n#   invocation, or if opening the connection is slow.\n#\n#  imap_peek\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   If set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever you\n#   fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing, but can\n#   make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option exists to appease\n#   speed freaks.\n#\n#  imap_servernoise\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP server as error\n#   messages. Since these messages are often harmless, or generated due to\n#   configuration problems on the server which are out of the users' hands, you\n#   may wish to suppress them at some point.\n#\n#  imap_user\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   Your login name on the IMAP server.\n#\n#   This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.\n#\n#  implicit_autoview\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If set to ``yes'', mutt will look for a mailcap entry with the copiousoutput\n#   flag  set for every MIME attachment it doesn't have an internal viewer\n#   defined for. If such an entry is found, mutt will use the viewer defined in\n#   that entry to convert the body part to text form.\n#\n#  include\n#\n#   Type: quadoption\n#   Default: ask-yes\n#\n#   Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to is\n#   included in your reply.\n#\n#  indent_string\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"> \"\n#\n#   Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a message to\n#   which you are replying.

The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the folder,\n#   will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index, giving the reader\n#   the context of a few messages before and after the message. This is useful,\n#   for example, to determine how many messages remain to be read in the current\n#   thread. One of the lines is reserved for the status bar from the index, so a\n#   pager_index_lines of 6 will only show 5 lines of the actual index. A value\n#   of 0 results in no index being shown.

If it set to yes, they do quit, if it is set to no, they have no\n#   effect,  and  if  it is set to ask-yes or ask-no, you are prompted for\n#   confirmation when you try to quit.\n#\n#  quote_regexp\n#\n#   Type: regular expression\n#   Default: \"^([ \\t]*[|>:}#])+\"\n#\n#   A regular expression used in the internal-pager to determine quoted sections\n#   of text in the body of a message.\n#\n#   Note: In order to use the quotedx patterns in the internal pager, you need\n#   to  set  this  to  a regular expression that matches exactly the quote\n#   characters at the beginning of quoted lines.\n#\n#  read_inc\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 10\n#\n#   If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display which message it is\n#   currently on when reading a mailbox. The message is printed after read_inc\n#   messages have been read (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will print a message when\n#   it  reads message 25, and then again when it gets to message 50). This\n#   variable is meant to indicate progress when reading large mailboxes which\n#   may take some time. When set to 0, only a single message will appear before\n#   the reading the mailbox.\n#\n#   Also see the `` $write_inc'' variable.\n#\n#  read_only\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.\n#\n#  realname\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   This variable specifies what \"real\" or \"personal\" name should be used when\n#   sending messages.\n#\n#   By default, this is the GCOS field from /etc/passwd. Note that this variable\n#   will not be used when the user has set a real name in the $from variable.\n#\n#  recall\n#\n#   Type: quadoption\n#   Default: ask-yes\n#\n#   Controls whether or not you are prompted to recall postponed messages when\n#   composing a new message. Also see `` $postponed''.\n#\n#   Setting this variable to ``yes'' is not generally useful, and thus not\n#   recommended.\n#\n#  record\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   This  specifies  the  file into which your outgoing messages should be\n#   appended. (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of your\n#   messages, but another way to do this is using the `` my_hdr'' command to\n#   create a Bcc: field with your email address in it.)\n#\n#   The  value  of  $record  is  overridden by the `` $force_name'' and ``\n#   $save_name'' variables, and the `` fcc-hook'' command.\n#\n#  reply_regexp\n#\n#   Type: regular expression\n#   Default: \"^(re([\\[0-9\\]+])*|aw):[ \\t]*\"\n#\n#   A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading and\n#   replying. The default value corresponds to the English \"Re:\" and the German\n#   \"Aw:\".\n#\n#  reply_self\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt will assume\n#   that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather than to\n#   yourself.\n#\n#  reply_to\n#\n#   Type: quadoption\n#   Default: ask-yes\n#\n#   If set, Mutt will ask you if you want to use the address listed in the\n#   Reply-To: header field when replying to a message. If you answer no, it will\n#   use the address in the From: header field instead. This option is useful for\n#   reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To: header field to the list\n#   address and you want to send a private message to the author of a message.\n#\n#  resolve\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next (possibly\n#   undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the current message is\n#   executed.\n#\n#  reverse_alias\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the \"personal\" name\n#   from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that matches the\n#   message's sender. For example, if you have the following alias:\n#\n#alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)\n#\n#   and then you receive mail which contains the following header:\n#\n#From: abd30425@somewhere.net\n#\n#   It  would  be  displayed  in the index menu as ``Joe User'' instead of\n#   ``abd30425@somewhere.net.'' This is useful when the person's e-mail address\n#   is not human friendly (like CompuServe addresses).\n#\n#  reverse_name\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine, move the\n#   messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages from there. If\n#   this variable is set, the default From: line of the reply messages is built\n#   using the address where you received the messages you are replying to. If\n#   the variable is unset, the From: line will use your address on the current\n#   machine.\n#\n#  reverse_realname\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   This variable fine-tunes the behaviour of the reverse_name feature. When it\n#   is set, mutt will use the address from incoming messages as-is, possibly\n#   including eventual real names. When it is unset, mutt will override any such\n#   realnames with the setting of the realname variable.\n#\n#  rfc2047_parameters\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When  this  variable  is  set,  Mutt will decode RFC-2047-encoded MIME\n#   parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt suggests you to save\n#   attachments to files named like this:\n#   =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=\n#\n#   When this variable is set interactively, the change doesn't have the desired\n#   effect before you have changed folders.\n#\n#   Note that this use of RFC 2047's encoding is explicitly, prohibited by the\n#   standard, but nevertheless encountered in the wild. Also note that setting\n#   this parameter will not have the effect that mutt generates this kind of\n#   encoding. Instead, mutt will unconditionally use the encoding specified in\n#   RFC 2231.\n#\n#  save_address\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If set, mutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a default\n#   folder for saving a mail. If `` $save_name'' or `` $force_name'' is set too,\n#   the selection of the fcc folder will be changed as well.\n#\n#  save_empty\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed when\n#   closed (the exception is `` $spoolfile'' which is never removed). If set,\n#   mailboxes are never removed.\n#\n#   Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt does not delete MH\n#   and Maildir directories.\n#\n#  save_name\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved. When set,\n#   a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the recipient address\n#   exists  (this  is  done by searching for a mailbox in the `` $folder''\n#   directory with the username part of the recipient address). If the mailbox\n#   exists, the outgoing message will be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the\n#   message is saved to the `` $record'' mailbox.\n#\n#   Also see the `` $force_name'' variable.\n#\n#  score\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off. This can be useful to\n#   selectively   disable   scoring   for  certain  folders  when  the  ``\n#   $score_threshold_delete'' variable and friends are used.\n#\n#  score_threshold_delete\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: -1\n#\n#   Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value\n#   of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by mutt. Since mutt\n#   scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting of this\n#   variable will never mark a message for deletion.\n#\n#  score_threshold_flag\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 9999\n#\n#   Messages wich have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this\n#   variable's value are automatically marked \"flagged\".\n#\n#  score_threshold_read\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: -1\n#\n#   Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value\n#   of this variable are automatically marked as read by mutt. Since mutt scores\n#   are  always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting of this\n#   variable will never mark a message read.\n#\n#  send_charset\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8\"\n#\n#   A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the first\n#   character set into which the text can be converted exactly. If your ``\n#   $charset'' is not iso-8859-1 and recipients may not understand UTF-8, it is\n#   advisable  to  include in the list an appropriate widely used standard\n#   character set (such as iso-8859-2, koi8-r or iso-2022-jp) either instead of\n#   or after \"iso-8859-1\".\n#\n#  sendmail\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi\"\n#\n#   Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt. Mutt\n#   expects  that the specified program interprets additional arguments as\n#   recipient addresses.\n#\n#  sendmail_wait\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 0\n#\n#   Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the `` $sendmail'' process to\n#   finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.\n#\n#   Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:\n#\n#   >0 \n#          number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing\n#\n#   0 \n#          wait forever for sendmail to finish\n#\n#   <0 \n#          always put sendmail in the background without waiting\n#\n#   Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child\n#   process will be put in a temporary file. If there is some error, you will be\n#   informed as to where to find the output.\n#\n#  shell\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   Command to use when spawning a subshell. By default, the user's login shell\n#   from /etc/passwd is used.\n#\n#  sig_dashes\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   If  set,  a  line  containing  ``-- '' will be inserted before your ``\n#   $signature''. It is strongly recommended that you not unset this variable\n#   unless your ``signature'' contains just your name. The reason for this is\n#   because many software packages use ``-- \\n'' to detect your signature. For\n#   example, Mutt has the ability to highlight the signature in a different\n#   color in the builtin pager.\n#\n#  sig_on_top\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded text.\n#   It is strongly recommended that you do not set this variable unless you\n#   really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take some heat from\n#   netiquette guardians.\n#\n#  signature\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"~/.signature\"\n#\n#   Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all outgoing\n#   messages. If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is assumed that\n#   filename is a shell command and input should be read from its stdout.\n#\n#  simple_search\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"~f %s | ~s %s\"\n#\n#   Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a real search pattern.\n#   A simple search is one that does not contain any of the ~ operators. See ``\n#   patterns'' for more information on search patterns.\n#\n#   For example, if you simply type joe at a search or limit prompt, Mutt will\n#   automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable. For the\n#   default value it would be:\n#\n#   ~f joe | ~s joe\n#\n#  smart_wrap\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   Controls the display of lines longer then the screen width in the internal\n#   pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary. If unset, lines\n#   are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the `` $markers'' variable.\n#\n#  smileys\n#\n#   Type: regular expression\n#   Default: \"(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])\"\n#\n#   The pager uses this variable to catch some common false positives of ``\n#   $quote_regexp'', most notably smileys in the beginning of a line\n#\n#  sleep_time\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 1\n#\n#   Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational\n#   messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging messages\n#   from the current folder. The default is to pause one second, so a value of\n#   zero for this option suppresses the pause.\n#\n#  sort\n#\n#   Type: sort order\n#   Default: date\n#\n#   Specifies how to sort messages in the index menu. Valid values are:\n#\n#   date or date-sent\n#   date-received\n#   from\n#   mailbox-order (unsorted)\n#   score\n#   size\n#   subject\n#   threads\n#   to\n#\n#   You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting order\n#   (example: set sort=reverse-date-sent).\n#\n#  sort_alias\n#\n#   Type: sort order\n#   Default: alias\n#\n#   Specifies how the entries in the `alias' menu are sorted. The following are\n#   legal values:\n#\n#   address (sort alphabetically by email address)\n#   alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)\n#   unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)\n#\n#  sort_aux\n#\n#   Type: sort order\n#   Default: date\n#\n#   When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted in\n#   relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees are\n#   sorted. This can be set to any value that `` $sort'' can, except threads (in\n#   that case, mutt will just use date-sent). You can also specify the last-\n#   prefix  in  addition to the reverse- prefix, but last- must come after\n#   reverse-. The last- prefix causes messages to be sorted against its siblings\n#   by which has the last descendant, using the rest of sort_aux as an ordering.\n#   For instance, set sort_aux=last- date-received would mean that if a new\n#   message is received in a thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed\n#   (or the first, if you have set sort=reverse-threads.) Note: For reversed ``\n#   $sort'' order $sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to\n#   do, but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).\n#\n#  sort_browser\n#\n#   Type: sort order\n#   Default: subject\n#\n#   Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser. By default, the entries\n#   are sorted alphabetically. Valid values:\n#\n#   alpha (alphabetically)\n#   date\n#   size\n#   unsorted\n#\n#   You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting order\n#   (example: set sort_browser=reverse-date).\n#\n#  sort_re\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   This  variable  is  only  useful  when  sorting  by  threads  with  ``\n#   $strict_threads'' unset. In that case, it changes the heuristic mutt uses to\n#   thread  messages by subject. With sort_re set, mutt will only attach a\n#   message as the child of another message by subject if the subject of the\n#   child  message  starts  with  a  substring  matching the setting of ``\n#   $reply_regexp''. With sort_re unset, mutt will attach the message whether or\n#   not this is the case, as long as the non-`` $reply_regexp'' parts of both\n#   messages are identical.\n#\n#  spoolfile\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot find it,\n#   you can specify its location with this variable. Mutt will automatically set\n#   this variable to the value of the environment variable $MAIL if it is not\n#   set.\n#\n#  status_chars\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"-*%A\"\n#\n#   Controls the characters used by the \"%r\" indicator in `` $status_format''.\n#   The first character is used when the mailbox is unchanged. The second is\n#   used when the mailbox has been changed, and it needs to be resynchronized.\n#   The third is used if the mailbox is in read-only mode, or if the mailbox\n#   will not be written when exiting that mailbox (You can toggle whether to\n#   write changes to a mailbox with the toggle-write operation, bound by default\n#   to \"%\"). The fourth is used to indicate that the current folder has been\n#   opened in attach- message mode (Certain operations like composing a new\n#   mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).\n#\n#  status_format\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default:  \"-%r-Mutt:  %f  [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d?\n#   Del:%d?%?F?    Flag:%F?%?t?   Tag:%t?%?p?   Post:%p?%?b?   Inc:%b?%?l?\n#   %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---\"\n#\n#   Controls the format of the status line displayed in the index menu. This\n#   string  is  similar  to  ``  $index_format'',  but  has its own set of\n#   printf()-like sequences:\n#\n#   %b \n#          number of mailboxes with new mail *\n#\n#   %d \n#          number of deleted messages *\n#\n#   %h \n#          local hostname\n#\n#   %f \n#          the full pathname of the current mailbox\n#\n#   %F \n#          number of flagged messages *\n#\n#   %l \n#          size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *\n#\n#   %L \n#          size (in bytes) of the messages shown (i.e., which match the current\n#          limit) *\n#\n#   %m \n#          the number of messages in the mailbox *\n#\n#   %M \n#          the number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *\n#\n#   %n \n#          number of new messages in the mailbox *\n#\n#   %o \n#          number of old unread messages\n#\n#   %p \n#          number of postponed messages *\n#\n#   %P \n#          percentage of the way through the index\n#\n#   %r \n#          modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-messageindicator,accordingto\n#          $status_chars\n#\n#   %s \n#          current sorting mode ( $sort)\n#\n#   %S \n#          current aux sorting method ( $sort_aux)\n#\n#   %t \n#          number of tagged messages *\n#\n#   %u \n#          number of unread messages *\n#\n#   %v \n#          Mutt version string\n#\n#   %V \n#          currently active limit pattern, if any *\n#\n#   %>X \n#          right justify the rest of the string and pad with \"X\"\n#\n#   %|X \n#          pad to the end of the line with \"X\"\n#\n#   * = can be optionally printed if nonzero\n#\n#   Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string if\n#   their value is nonzero. For example, you may only want to see the number of\n#   flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not particularly\n#   meaningful.  To  optionally print a string based upon one of the above\n#   sequences, the following construct is used\n#\n#   %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?\n#\n#   where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and optional_string\n#   is  the  string  you  would  like  printed  if status_char is nonzero.\n#   optional_string may contain other sequence as well as normal text, but you\n#   may not nest optional strings.\n#\n#   Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of new\n#   messages in a mailbox: %?n?%n new messages.?\n#\n#   Additionally you can switch between two strings, the first one, if a value\n#   is zero, the second one, if the value is nonzero, by using the following\n#   construct: %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?\n#\n#   You can additionally force the result of any printf-like sequence to be\n#   lowercase by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore (_) sign.\n#   For example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase, you\n#   would use: %_h\n#\n#  status_on_top\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   Setting this variable causes the ``status bar'' to be displayed on the first\n#   line of the screen rather than near the bottom.\n#\n#  strict_threads\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   If  set,  threading  will  only  make  use  of the ``In-Reply-To'' and\n#   ``References'' fields when you `` $sort'' by message threads. By default,\n#   messages with the same subject are grouped together in ``pseudo threads.''\n#   This may not always be desirable, such as in a personal mailbox where you\n#   might have several unrelated messages with the subject ``hi'' which will get\n#   grouped together.\n#\n#  suspend\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When unset, mutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's susp key,\n#   usually ``control-Z''. This is useful if you run mutt inside an xterm using\n#   a command like xterm -e mutt.\n#\n#  text_flowed\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, mutt will generate text/plain; format=flowed attachments. This\n#   format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally just\n#   looks like ordinary text. To actually make use of this format's features,\n#   you'll need support in your editor.\n#\n#   Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is set.\n#\n#  thread_received\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent to thread\n#   messages by subject.\n#\n#  thorough_search\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in section `` patterns''\n#   above. If set, the headers and attachments of messages to be searched are\n#   decoded before searching. If unset, messages are searched as they appear in\n#   the folder.\n#\n#  tilde\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the\n#   screen with a tilde (~).\n#\n#  timeout\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 600\n#\n#   This variable controls the number of seconds Mutt will wait for a key to be\n#   pressed in the main menu before timing out and checking for new mail. A\n#   value of zero or less will cause Mutt not to ever time out.\n#\n#  tmpdir\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its temporary\n#   files needed for displaying and composing messages.\n#\n#  to_chars\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \" +TCFL\"\n#\n#   Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you. The first\n#   character is the one used when the mail is NOT addressed to your address\n#   (default: space). The second is used when you are the only recipient of the\n#   message (default: +). The third is when your address appears in the TO\n#   header field, but you are not the only recipient of the message (default:\n#   T). The fourth character is used when your address is specified in the CC\n#   header field, but you are not the only recipient. The fifth character is\n#   used to indicate mail that was sent by you. The sixth character is used to\n#   indicate when a mail was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to (default:\n#   L).\n#\n#  tunnel\n#\n#   Type: string\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a command instead of\n#   a  raw  socket. You may be able to use this to set up preauthenticated\n#   connections to your IMAP/POP3 server. Example:\n#\n#   tunnel=\"ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd\"\n#\n#   NOTE: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote\n#   machine without having to enter a password.\n#\n#  use_8bitmime\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: no\n#\n#   Warning: do not set this variable unless you are using a version of sendmail\n#   which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail 8.8.x) or you may not\n#   be able to send mail.\n#\n#   When set, Mutt will invoke `` $sendmail'' with the -B8BITMIME flag when\n#   sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.\n#\n#  use_domain\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the @host\n#   portion) with the value of `` $hostname''. If unset, no addresses will be\n#   qualified.\n#\n#  use_from\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, Mutt will generate the `From:' header field when sending messages.\n#   If  unset,  no  `From:' header field will be generated unless the user\n#   explicitly sets one using the `` my_hdr'' command.\n#\n#  user_agent\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When  set,  mutt  will add a \"User-Agent\" header to outgoing messages,\n#   indicating which version of mutt was used for composing them.\n#\n#  visual\n#\n#   Type: path\n#   Default: \"\"\n#\n#   Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the ~v command is given in the\n#   builtin editor.\n#\n#  wait_key\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after shell- escape,\n#   pipe-message, pipe-entry, print-message, and print-entry commands.\n#\n#   It is also used when viewing attachments with `` auto_view'', provided that\n#   the corresponding mailcap entry has a needsterminal flag, and the external\n#   program is interactive.\n#\n#   When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When unset, Mutt will wait for a\n#   key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.\n#\n#  weed\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   When set, mutt will weed headers when when displaying, forwarding, printing,\n#   or replying to messages.\n#\n#  wrap_search\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   Controls whether searches wrap around the end of the mailbox.\n#\n#   When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) message. When unset,\n#   searches will not wrap.\n#\n#  wrapmargin\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 0\n#\n#   Controls the margin left at the right side of the terminal when mutt's pager\n#   does smart wrapping.\n#\n#  write_inc\n#\n#   Type: number\n#   Default: 10\n#\n#   When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every write_inc messages\n#   to indicate progress. If set to 0, only a single message will be displayed\n#   before writing a mailbox.\n#\n#   Also see the `` $read_inc'' variable.\n#\n#  write_bcc\n#\n#   Type: boolean\n#   Default: yes\n#\n#   Controls whether mutt writes out the Bcc header when preparing messages to\n#   be sent.
